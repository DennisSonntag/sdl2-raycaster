ow do i implement the logic for tetris. show me step by step in pseudo code 

Sure, here's an example of how you could implement the basic logic for a Tetris game in pseudo code:

    Define the game board and its dimensions
        board_width = 10
        board_height = 20
        board = [board_width][board_height]

    Define the game pieces and their shapes
        pieces = [I, J, L, O, S, T, Z]
        Each piece has a shape defined as a 4x4 matrix of booleans

    Create a function to generate a random piece
        generate_random_piece():
            index = random integer between 0 and 6
            return pieces[index]

    Create a function to rotate a piece
        rotate_piece(piece):
            new_piece = empty 4x4 matrix
            for i in range(4):
                for j in range(4):
                    new_piece[i][j] = piece[3-j][i]
            return new_piece

    Create a function to move a piece down the board
        move_down(piece, row, col):
            if can_move(piece, row+1, col):
                remove_piece(piece, row, col)
                add_piece(piece, row+1, col)
            else:
                lock_piece(piece, row, col)
                generate_new_piece()

    Create a function to check if a piece can move to a new position
        can_move(piece, row, col):
            for i in range(4):
                for j in range(4):
                    if piece[i][j] and (row+i >= board_height or col+j < 0 or col+j >= board_width or board[row+i][col+j]):
                        return False
            return True

    Create a function to add a piece to the board
        add_piece(piece, row, col):
            for i in range(4):
                for j in range(4):
                    if piece[i][j]:
                        board[row+i][col+j] = True

    Create a function to remove a piece from the board
        remove_piece(piece, row, col):
            for i in range(4):
                for j in range(4):
                    if piece[i][j]:
                        board[row+i][col+j] = False

    Create a function to lock a piece in place on the board
        lock_piece(piece, row, col):
            add_piece(piece, row, col)

    Create a function to generate a new piece and add it to the board

    generate_new_piece():
        piece = generate_random_piece()
        row = 0
        col = board_width / 2 - 2
        add_piece(piece, row, col)

    Create a game loop that repeatedly updates the game state

    while not game_over:
        handle_input()
        move_down(current_piece, current_row, current_col)
        if game_over:
            end_game()

This is just a basic example of how you could implement Tetris logic in pseudo code. There are many additional features and optimizations you could add to make the game more interesting and challenging.

how would i define the pieces

In Tetris, there are seven types of pieces, each with its own shape:

    I: a straight piece consisting of four blocks
    J: a piece shaped like a mirrored L, consisting of three blocks and a fourth block sticking out
    L: a piece shaped like an L, consisting of three blocks and a fourth block sticking out
    O: a square piece consisting of four blocks
    S: a piece shaped like an S, consisting of two blocks in an "S" shape and two blocks below
    T: a piece shaped like a T, consisting of three blocks in a "T" shape and a fourth block below the center block
    Z: a piece shaped like a mirrored S, consisting of two blocks in a "Z" shape and two blocks below

You can define each of these pieces as a 4x4 matrix of booleans, where True represents a block and False represents an empty space. For example, the I piece could be defined like this:

graphql

piece_I = [
  [False, False, False, False],
  [True, True, True, True],
  [False, False, False, False],
  [False, False, False, False]
]

You can define the other pieces in a similar way, using True values to represent the blocks in each shape.

should they all be a 4x4 matrix ?

Yes, it's common to represent all Tetris pieces as 4x4 matrices, even though some pieces don't use all four rows or columns. Using a consistent matrix size makes it easier to handle rotations and movement for all pieces in a uniform way.

For pieces that don't use all four rows or columns, the extra rows or columns can be represented as empty spaces (i.e. False values) in the matrix. When rotating a piece, you can ignore any empty rows or columns and only rotate the non-empty part of the matrix. For example, the L piece can be defined like this:

graphql

piece_L = [
  [False, True, False, False],
  [False, True, False, False],
  [False, True, True, False],
  [False, False, False, False]
]

In this case, the L piece only uses three rows and two columns, and the extra row and column are represented as empty spaces.

how would i implement ghost pieces

A ghost piece is a feature in Tetris that shows where a piece will land if it is dropped straight down without any further rotation or movement. To implement ghost pieces in your Tetris game, you can follow these steps:

    Create a copy of the current piece and store it as the ghost piece.
    Move the ghost piece downwards until it collides with another block or reaches the bottom of the game board.
    Draw the ghost piece on the game board using a different color or transparency level to differentiate it from the active piece.

Here's an example pseudo-code implementation of the above steps:

bash

# Create a copy of the active piece and store it as the ghost piece
ghost_piece = copy(active_piece)

# Move the ghost piece downwards until it collides with another block or reaches the bottom
while can_move_down(ghost_piece):
    move_piece_down(ghost_piece)

# Draw the ghost piece on the game board using a different color or transparency level
draw_piece(ghost_piece, color='gray', alpha=0.5)

In this code, can_move_down(piece) checks if the given piece can be moved down one row without colliding with another block, and move_piece_down(piece) moves the given piece down one row. draw_piece(piece, color, alpha) draws the given piece on the game board using the specified color and transparency level.

Note that the ghost piece should be updated every time the active piece is moved or rotated, so that it accurately reflects the position of the active piece.
